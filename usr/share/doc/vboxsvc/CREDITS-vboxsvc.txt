Credits are where credits are due

* Alexandre Dumont - initial author of a simple SMF method and manifest, which
  grew into this project.
* sjorge - idea and initial implementation of a stub service to delay startup
  of all VMs as a new common dependency (vbox-delay-on-boot.xml).
* Edward Ned Harvey - idea and constructive discussion for zfs-zvolrights - a
  script to retain POSIX/ACL access rights on device nodes owned by non-roots
  (notably user-owned ZFS volumes) as a workaround of Solaris/OI deficiency.
* Dimitri Asarowski - revision of the installation documentation which led to
  a number of bugfixes in packaging and code.
* Gordon Ross - initial script for connections to serial console with socat
* Active users of VirtualBox forums and OpenIndiana mail-lists whose requests,
  questions and comments led and lead to further development of this package.

Thanks to all,
//Jim Klimov - current package author and maintainer
